# DX 704 Project 7

## Instructions

The instructions below for GitHub and Codespaces are a suggested workflow.
You may use any environment that you wish to work on this project.
However, if the environment that you use is too different, then it may limit support by learning facilitators.
Google Colab will be supported, as will most other environments based on Visual Studio Code.

When you are done with your project, make sure to submit all the specified files in Gradescope, and check the autograder results.
Some autograder results may be withheld until after the final late submission deadline.
